<!-- ## Zheng Wei Lim -->

I am a PhD student at the University of Melbourne, developing computational methods for _difficult_ (i.e. cross-cultural or low-resource) translation. I have also worked on topics relating to **multilinguality**, **psycholinguistics** and **interpretability**. 

My long-term research interests include: 
 - understanding how model architecture, training data and algorithms impose learning biases on language models, and their limitations in representing more complex language phenomena
 - studying how large-scale models navigate varying (sometimes conflicting) goals, and developing controllable mechanisms that drive convergent or adaptable behaviour across time, domains, languages and modalities.

I am jointly advised by [Ekaterina Vylomova](http://kat.academy/), [Charles Kemp](https://www.charleskemp.com/) and [Trevor Cohn](https://trevorcohn.github.io/). In 2024, I was a student researcher at **Google Research Australia**.
