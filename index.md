<!-- ## Zheng Wei Lim -->

I am a PhD student at **The University of Melbourne**, studying cross-cultural challenges in translation. I am broadly interested in **multilinguality** and **machine translation** (MT). My current research goals include identifying difficult-to-translate texts, understanding the challenges of MT evaluation and developing MT systems that cater to a wide range of applications. I am advised by [Ekaterina Vylomova](http://kat.academy/), [Charles Kemp](https://www.charleskemp.com/) and [Trevor Cohn](https://trevorcohn.github.io/).

Now a student researcher at **Google Research Australia**, I also work on low-resource translation using large language models.
