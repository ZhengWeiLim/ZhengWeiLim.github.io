<!-- ## Zheng Wei Lim -->

I am a PhD student at **The University of Melbourne**, where I study systematically cross-cultural challenges in translation. Broadly I am interested in **multilinguality** and **machine translation** (MT) beyond lexical mapping. My current research goals include identifying difficult-to-translate texts, understanding the challenges of MT evaluation and developing adaptable MT systems to support cross-cultural communication in various contexts. I am jointly advised by [Ekaterina Vylomova](http://kat.academy/), [Charles Kemp](https://www.charleskemp.com/) and [Trevor Cohn](https://trevorcohn.github.io/). 

In 2024 I joined **Google Research Australia** as a student researcher, working on improving low-resource translation and cross-lingual knowledge transfer with large language models.
